# ARPES Study in CsV<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>5</sub> Kagome Crystals
- Investigated the band structure of 9% Sn-doped CsV<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>5</sub> using ARPES and identified a stripe order with a gap opening at the Van Hove singularity.

- A 2×2 CDW feature gap opened as well.

- The two kind of gaps demonstrated the existence of strip order.
