# ARPES Study in CsV<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>5</sub> Kagome Crystals
- Investigated the band structure of 9% Sn-doped CsV<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>5</sub> using ARPES and identified a stripe order with a gap opening at the Van Hove singularity.

- The two kind of gaps demonstrated the existence of strip order.

- The nesting instability arises once the 2 × 2 reconstruction of the original Fermi surface is lifted and the Fermi level is shifted downward via hole-doping.<br>

# Fabrication of twisted TMD devices and STM study in twisted TMD moiré systems
- Fabricated a twisted double bilayer WSe2 device with a 182° twist angle.(<strong>Bn Sliding</strong>)
- Fabricated a twisted bilayer WSe2 device with a 60° twist angle.(<strong>Bn Sliding</strong>)

#### Bn Sliding
- Use PVC to pull up the top Bn and then scratch the nanoribbon graphite to get a clean and open surface device.
